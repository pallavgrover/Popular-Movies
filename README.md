# Popular-Movies
This is the first project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. The purpose of this project was to built an app,  to help users discover popular and highly rated movies on the web. It displays a scrolling grid of movie, launches a details screen whenever a particular movie is selected, and read user reviews. This app utilizes core Android user interface components and fetches movie information using themoviedb.org web API.



# Getting Started

App uses The Movie Database API. You have to enter your API key in order to run the app. You can create your own one very easy! https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup?language=en-EN. When you get it, just set it here: "popular-movies-app/gradle.properties"
